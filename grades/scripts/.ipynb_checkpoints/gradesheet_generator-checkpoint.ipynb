I know you spent a lot of time outside of class working on the model. We already had a good model at 94 percent but you wanted to see if you could improve it further which you did. It was also apparent when answering questions and providing ideas that you had a clear understanding of the concepts.Collin: 2- Met requirements. I know being the first one to be team lead was intimidating and slightly more time consuming. I felt like you did well approaching this. Allowing us to work while still trying to direct us. You also contributed helpful information to the report and machine-learning model. A suggestion for next time is you could spend more time trying different models.Trevor: 4- Significantly Deficient. Trevor, the piece of advice I would give is come to the meetings more prepared. It is important to do the reading before the project and truly understand what the concepts are. This is all new to everyone and I understand the concepts are difficult, but I felt like you were ill prepared. But I know you already recognized this and will be more prepared for the next project. Second, the one task you volunteered to complete outside of class, you failed to do so.

Sharing your ideas, showing up in meetings, making the Jupyter Gist for the summary. Thanks for all of your hard work! Trevor Neri: 1 – Trevor, thank you for asking all the hard questions. There were questions that you asked that I did not quite understand as well, so keep asking those questions.

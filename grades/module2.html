<h1>Group 1</h1>
<h2>Riley Smith:</h2>
<pre><code>- Riley to Riley: 1 I thought I was an asset to the team but wasn't afraid to ask questions when I wasn't sure how to do something. I think I tried my best to learn the material and it showed on our project. One piece of advice that I would have for myself is dedicate more time outside of class to work on the projects.
- Jeremy to Riley: 2  All requirements met.Riley, you produced some great charts and did some great analytics on the data. Your work was critical to our team.
- Isaac to Riley: 2  The work you did in researching what types of methods and techniques we could use in trying to sort through the data and in binning it to try and organize it made heavy work light. One piece of advice I would give is to give more explanation about the things you suggest so others will be able to follow along more easily. Also make sure to keep it simple and clear if possible.
- Josh to Riley: 1 Riley's skills in python really set him apart this week as a great asset for our team. He worked hard and really helped us with our python coding to achieve the goals of our team.

</code></pre>
<h2>Jeremy Jones:</h2>
<pre><code>- Jeremy to Jeremy: 3  Slightly Deficient. Jeremy, give better direction guiding the team and designating team members with tasks.
- Riley to Jeremy: 1 I think you were a great team leader, especially given the fact that this was our first time working on a project like this, I think we were all a little lost at the beginning but I think you really helped us get it together. My advice for you would be help the team come up with a very specific plan of what is going to get done every day in order to have the best possible outcome.
- Isaac to Jeremy: 1 The help you gave when we were trying to deduce how to increase model accuracy was great. The suggestions you gave throughout helpful and much needed. I think one thing that would be make a big difference as the lead for the case study would be making jobs and efforts clear, and if someone wants something to do because they don't know what to do, then giving them something to get started will go a long way.
- Josh to Jeremy: 1 Jeremy was great on this. His models and leadership really stood out and he take charge as the week leader of the case study.
- Jeremy Total: [3, 1, 1, 1]   (23.25 + 25 + 25 + 25) / 4  = 24.5625     (Everyone gave him a one except himself, might want to check this.)
</code></pre>
<h2>Isaac Malmstrom:</h2>
<pre><code>- Riley to Isaac:  1 You gave some great advice during this project and were always helpful over slack in Answering questions. My advice is to practice making more machine learning models. It may be a little daunting at the beginning but it will be a huge help to you.
- Jeremy to Isaac: 4 Significantly deficient. Isaac, my best advice is to be active in slack, and communicate specific roadblocks so that the rest of your team can give advice on how to proceed.
- Isaac to Isaac: 3  I was lost from the beginning in regards to how to actually implement the machine learning side of things in regard to python implementation. I was able to follow along outside of everything else, from the writing of the case study to the writing of the executive summary. I would suggest for myself to try and work on being more knowledgeable with python and the machine learning functions and libraries.
- Josh to Isaac: 1 Really good work. Isaac compiled most of our executive summary and did a really good job on that. He was honest about not being great in python but contributed in every way that he could.
- Isaac Total: [1, 4, 3, 1]   (25 + 19.5 + 22 + 25) / 4 = 22.875   (He was hard on himself, and Jeremy was extremely hard on him.)
</code></pre>
<h2>Josh Peterson:</h2>
<pre><code>- Josh to Josh: 2 Needs to improve on Python skills.
- Riley to Josh: 1 I thought you were a great asset to the team and did an especially good job when it came to data analysis. One piece of advice I would give is to keep practicing making more machine learning models.
- Jeremy to Josh: 2  All requirements met. Josh, you were great about self motivating and filling in the blanks where there rest of us were deficient.
- Isaac to Josh: 3  The support you gave to the group was awesome. It definitely helped when writing up the documents and case study rough draft. Two pieces of advice I would give is to speak up more. Your thoughts and suggestions can only help. Also, I would say to be more willing to help with the implementation of the machine learning side of the case study. You have a lot of knowledge regarding python and it shows. It can be a great asset to the team.

<h2>Holly VanAuker:</h2>
<pre><code>- Holly to Holly: 3 Slightly Deficient  Holly, you were an okay teammate. Although you were present in class, it didn't feel like you were completely present in our team discussions. You did feel like you were trying to make some effort and contribution, but it fell flat most of the time. I would suggest that you really read up and understand the model for the project so you can contribute more with your team. 
- Anika to Holly: 3 know that you were busy with your other team and had other things going on, but I don't feel like you put in much effort into our group. I think if you tried a few more things and weren't scared of being wrong you would feel better about your contributions too! We all have no idea what we are doing, don't be afraid of asking questions!
- Chloe to Holly: None submitted
- David to Holly: 1 Holly, I really like working with ya and I think you are pretty active and positive, but that one day that we have to go home to do our assignment that's given by the team lead. The next day when u text the group that u were just starting to work on it an hour before class, tbh I don't really know how to reply. I understand that we have time that's busy, so I didn't say much about it. To be honest, who is not busy in college. Everyone has to still take time out off their busy schedule to do the homework, so I hope that you can at least do the amount to report to the team.

<h2>David Yang:</h2>
<pre><code>- David to David: 1 I think I will gave them all 1 because they all work really hard to try to be proactive.
- Anika to David: 2 I think you are super smart and you contributed a lot. One thing I would say is I got the feeling you may have worked on things that were less important to the main concepts. I could be wrong and exploration is awesome! But, I think it would be helpful to focus a little on the main concepts. 
- Chloe to David: None submitted
- Holly to David: 2 all requirements met  David, you were a really awesome teammate. When you were in class, you had excellent ideas, and you really helped shaped the ideas we were trying to work with. The one thing I think you could improve on would be being more open as a teammate. It felt like you were undercutting ideas because you would wait until the last minute to speak up.

<h1>Group 3</h1>
<h2>Reece Brown:</h2>
<pre><code>- Reece to Reece: 3 Slightly Deficient. I feel like didn't give my all and do everything that I needed to do. I did manage to get everything done, but I know I could have done better.
- John to Reece: 1 Reece, great job on your graph that was in the executive summary. If I could give you one suggestion, it would be to plan ahead for busier weeks in the semester. 
- Kaelan to Reece:  2  Met Requirements. You did a very good job with your side of the project. You generated great reports, created a model we could use for comparison, and your outside programming skills were useful in finding things in the Python language. If I could give you a suggestion, I would say that you tend to hyper fixate. If you cannot solve a problem immediately, you will only try to work on that. I suggest that if you are spending so much time on a problem you should drop it, work on something else, and then come back to it.
- Stephen to Reece: None Submitted
- Chris to Reece: 1 Reece is awesome and always brings a great sense of humor. He did a really good job with this project Improvement: I think Reece did a very good job; I am not sure I can give honest constructive improvements at this moment.

<h2>John Cornelison:</h2>
<pre><code>- John to John: 1 It was a little bit harder for me to wrap my head around the decision tree, but I was able to get a model working. Chris helped me out a lot. If I could give my self one suggestion to improve, it would be to get the model done faster. 
- Reece to John:  2 All requirements met. John I think you did a great job on everything you did. You were helpful during the team meetings and were able to answer questions very well.
- Kaelan to John: 2  Met Requirements. You made some great visualizations for us. I could see your skills in this area, and they showed. My only piece of advice for you would be to speak up more. You have great suggestions and ideas; share them! Do not be afraid to speak up when you think a project should go one way. 
- Stephen to John: None Submitted
- Chris to John: Rating: 2 strengths: John was great in communicating and was more than willing to do what was asked for him. I'm not sure if he was able to make all 3 trees, but I know he at least completed one. Improvement: I think John could ask questions sooner on concepts about the code he is struggling with earlier in the project. But I do not think this is a major problem, He's going to end up being just fine this semester.
- John Total: [1, 2, 2, 2]    (25 + 23.25 + 23.25 + 23.25) / 4 = 23.6875
</code></pre>
<h2>Kaelan Mcgurk:</h2>
<pre><code>- Kaelan to Kaelan: 2  Met Requirements. You do have a good grasp on programming in Python and generating reports. I can see the very beginnings of a great machine learning programmer starting. I would say that you should read more in    depth about the machine learning process so as to not just go through the motions. Actually learn how to manipulate the data set to create a better model. 
- Reece to Kaelan:  2 All requirements met. Kealan, I think you did a good job this week. I didn't really have a lot of interaction with everything you did, but you were helpful and able to answer questions whenever I had them.
- John to Kaelan: 1 Kaelan, great job on getting a model ready early in the week. I feel like it really helped the team get started. If I could give you one suggestion, it would be to proactively share what you learned with the team.
- Stephen to Kaelan: None Submitted
- Chris to Kaelan: 1 Kaelen was awesome and always asked questions. He is also very knowledgeable about machine learning and python. Great guy! Improvement: I am not that sure what to write. Right now, I think he is doing fine. In the future If I genuinely feel something, he can improve on I will write it.

<h2>Stephen Sharp:</h2>
<pre><code>- Stephen to Stephen: None Submitted
- Reece to Stephen: 2 All requirements met. Stephen, I think you did a good job this week. I didn't have much interaction with the things that you did, but you were able to be a great help to me and I apricate everything you did. Keep up the good work!
- John to Stephen: 1 Steven, great job on getting the model to 98%. I understand that your model may have been overfitted, but you showed great understanding in how a decision tree works.
- Kaelan to Stephen: 2  Met Requirements. You have a great grasp on the subject of machine learning. You were able to give us many different and very unique models with very different accuracy scores, showing that you are able to manipulate the data well. If I could give you a suggestion, I would say that you should speak out more to the group. You have great insights but seem worried to share them. 
- Chris to Stephen: 1 Stephen had some really cool graphs that he was able to make and he went above and beyond in creating multiple models with over and under sampling. Improvement: I wish Stephen would be more vocal on additional things he's trying out, that way we can all benefit from him teaching us. He made some really cool charts I would have loved to learn how to make.

<h2>Chris Trivino:</h2>
<pre><code>- Chris to Chris: 1 I worked hard and met with Noah multiple times to learn from him and learn additional concepts. I also tried to understand concepts and potential problems our team would face that way I could help the other guys out if they struggled with certain parts Improvement: I could have been better at communicating, maybe I could have asked if a text message would be more effective. I could have run my meetings more effective and had people present visualizations they had made. 
- Reece to Chris: 1 Above and Beyond. Chris, you did a fantastic job as team lead this week. Your insights in slack were very helpful and helped lead the whole team in the right direction. 
- John to Chris: 1 Chris, I think you did a great job leading the team and getting the extra help from Noah when we had questions. You also did a great job on the executive summary. If I could give you one suggestion, it would be to ask for help from the team in getting the executive summary done. 
- Kaelan to Chris: 1 Above and Beyond. You were an outstanding first manager. You made sure we all knew our part, you helped us with whatever we needed, you sent us links to resources outside of the general pandas or Altair help pages, and you would constantly check in with us about our progress. Very well done.

<h1>Group 4</h1>
<h2>Domenick Casper:</h2>
<pre><code>- Domenick to Domenick: 1 You spent a lot of time working on the model, and gaining insights. You need to spend more time with the visuals and gain some more insights that can help us get a lot of things done. Spend more time working on what is asked of you.
- Stephen to Domenick: 1 Great contributions. You did a great job giving us a foundation for everyone to work with in this project as most of us do not have much experience with python. 
- Gui to Domenick: 1 I have nothing to say. You did great! Thank you for all the help. As the one with most Python experience, and you were not afraid of taking the responsibility and guide us through. Just keep it up.
- Alfredo to Domenick: 1 I think you tried hard to help move the project forward and kept coming with ideas on how to approach the model. You also did a great job communicating with the team and spent significant time working on the model.
- Leonardo to Domenick: (2) The hands on coding guy. Thank you for knowing a bit of Python to save this group from the slaughter.  Without you, we would not have done half of the assignment. Great insights and always on time for the meetings.

<h2>Stephen Harrison:</h2>
<pre><code>- Stephen to Stephen: 3 Slightly deficient. Stephen, to best contribute to the team, you must communicate. You were behind in joining the slack channel and that caused you to miss out on some progress updates etc. that would be helpful to know earlier in the project. 
- Domenick to Stephen:  3  You add a lot of insights during our meetings, but we need you to help more. Please make it a priority to learn some Python and learn how to use this language!
- Gui to Stephen: 2 You had good insights. I think you could share more your opinion. Anything to add is valid and I believe we all need to do this more.
- Alfredo to Stephen: 5. I think you should be more proactive in how to help the project and don't miss the meetings.
- Leonardo to Stephen: (3) You participated in all meetings, but I still wonder how your voice sounds like. I do not think I have ever heard you in a meeting. Maybe you can start participating more and we will be a stronger team with your input for sure.

<pre><code>- Gui to Gui: 3 I really had a hard time understand this first assignment. My participation could have been better in asking questions and going after the answers to contribute in the team efforts.
- Domenick to Gui: 5  You need to participate in our meetings, and try to learn Python. It will help us all if we can all gain insights instead of just a few of us.
- Stephen to Gui: 2 good work. Your help with our summary was appreciated, just be confident in sharing any insights you have that might help other group members. 
- Alfredo to Gui: 5. I think you should be more proactive in how to help the project and don't miss the meetings.
- Leonardo to Gui: (4) You did not participate enough in my opinion. You missed most of our meetings and did not help on the summary. One thing you can do to improve is participate and provide insights that I know you have that will benefit the group.

<h2>Alfredo Pena Polanco:</h2>
<pre><code>- Alfredo to Alfredo: 1. I think you did a great job dividing the project into small tasks and reminding the team in what we should be working on. You were also good at finding small ways in which we could improve the model as well as finding patterns in the data. You can do better a communicating your findings in the meetings and not being so shy about it. 
- Domenick to Alfredo: 1 You are a natural born leader, and you helped us get this assignment done. If I could make a suggestion on how you can improve, try to make it clear what we should have done before next class. Make sure we all understand, and we will do well!
- Stephen to Alfredo: 1 Great contributions. You did a good job as our team executive and keeping us on track. 
- Gui to Alfredo: 1 Thanks for being the PM for this week. You showed responsibility and understanding of what we were doing.
- Leonardo to Alfredo: (2) Our group's leader, you were great at the end of the week but not so organized at the beginning which made us all feel lost for half of the week. Better organization would have helped this group a lot. You gave great feedback throughout the assignment.

I am terrible at Python but I now how the logic works and Domenick, Alfredo, and I were able to finalize that model to the current accuracy. Not the best week for myself or the group but I know that if I prioritize my time better I will be able to assist my team more. 
- Domenick to Leonardo: 5  You need to participate in our meetings and learn some Python. That will be the most beneficial in our success in our team.
- Stephen to Leonardo: 2 good work. Be sure to volunteer anything you think of that can shed light on different ways to approach or think about a problem or topic. You may know something someone else doesn't.
- Gui to Leonardo: 2  You were honest in what you knew and in what you didn't. I think that shows that you are willing to learn. I like that.

<h1>Group 5</h1>
<h2>Andrew Robert Burns:</h2>
<pre><code>- Andrew to Andrew: 3  Slightly deficient. As the first project manager of the group, I feel like I did all right. I wrote down everyone's tasks after every meeting and was always open in the evenings if someone needed direction. But I feel like I cut corners in some respects with the actual model: after some testing, we decided to just get rid of all the missing data, and then we didn't spend time pruning our random forest. My piece of advice to myself is to pay closer attention to how I'm cleaning the data and to understand models better before using them.
- Rachelle to Andrew: 1 You were a great team leader, by writing down the daily tasks and helping the conversation stay on topic of what we needed to accomplish during the meeting. 
- Jae to Andrew: 1 He worked really hard and gave his time to teach me. I think he has the most knowledge and interest in machine learning in this group.
- Jonathon to Andrew: 1 Great Leader. Andrew was good at coordinating team meetings, keeping us on task and assigning roles to each member. Additionally, Andrew helped us significantly with the code. He was the one who introduced heatmaps and random forests to the group.  Andrew was helpful and accommodating. One suggestion would be to have a little bit of a game plan before a meeting that would allow the conversation to flow more fluidly and minimize conversation gaps.

<pre><code>- Rachelle to Rachelle: 2  Was able to add to the team meetings but I feel like I could be more aware of the conversations made in slack and try to submit my portion earlier during the day.
- Andrew to Rachelle: 3  Slightly deficient. The one piece of advice I have is to let us know if you don't have time to finish a task. You're sharp and probably understand more of the content than we do, so whenever you miss a task, the meeting doesn't turn out as great as it could've.
- Jae to Rachelle: 1 I liked your work because I have not thought to analyze it in your way. I learned the idea of data analysis from you.
- Jonathon to Rachelle: 2  Good team member. Finished all of her required work on time. Made it to all meetings. One suggestion try contributing to the conversation more, your input is usually helpful.

<h2>Jae Jung:</h2>
<pre><code>- Jae to Jae: 1 I think I had lots of worries this time. I think I should not be in a hurry so much. And I think I need to know more functions to express my thoughts better.
- Andrew to Jae: 2  All requirements were met. You were always asking when we could meet up and get things done, which motivated us to stay focused. You are also very good with math and very analytical. If I could give you one piece of advice, it would be to know the audience you're speaking to; sometimes the audience isn't as good with math and needs a simplified version.
- Rachelle to Jae:  1 Great job for taking on the final decision tree and asking for help when you need clarification. You made a major contribution to the executive summary so thank you! 
- Jonathon to Jae: 2  Good team member. Finished all of his required work on time. Made it to all meetings. One suggestion I have, be more confident in your opinions and do not be afraid to speak up. Your questions are helpful and help us stay on task.

<pre><code>- Jonathon to Jonathon: 2  I did all my work that was assigned to me. I went to all the meetings and I helped to the best of my ability. 
- Andrew to Jonathon:  3  Slightly deficient. It was awesome when you were open and honest about how we were doing something in the project, whether good or bad. Your feedback would steer us in the right direction. If I could give you one piece of advice, it would be to speak up more often if you see we're doing something wrong or if it could be improved. You're also a good public speaker. 
- Rachelle to Jonathon: 1 I believe that you contributed well to the group and spoke up when we needed aid. As well as helping the team in splitting the key tasks. You also explained clearly during the presentation in class!
- Jae to Jonathon: 1 You completed the work earlier and well. I liked your work.

<h1><strong>Group 6</strong></h1>
<h2>Chris Brookhart</h2>
<pre><code>- Chris Brookhart to Chris Brookhart: 1Above and Beyond.  Most of the other members of our team have stronger technical skills than I do, but Isought to make up for any deficiency by simply working harder than nearly everyone else on the team.  Also, I feel thatmy past experienceservingas a companyexecutivebrought a unique perspective to the teamin helping them understandhow to communicate well to an executive audience.
- Wyatt Ogden to Chris Brookhart: 1: Excellent job, the time you spent was a great boon to the rest of the group. Continue to come to class and share what you've been doing. Even if you feel the results aren't great, it may help other members of the team have insights.
- Bretton Steiner to Chris Brookhart: 1 Above and Beyond. Chris, I think you deserve this rating because of all of the extra time and effort you spent figuring out the project. I believe you said at one point that you had worked about 20 hours on the case study. That's insane! But, if I could give you one piece of advice, it would be to maybe spend a little less time than 20 hours on future case studies. Your energy towards the work drove our team to go further than I thought we would, but you shouldn't have to put in a huge amount of time for us to succeed. I hope I am not coming across as negative as that is not the intention. Thanks for being such a great teammate!
- Jordan Watts to Chris Brookhart: 1You have shown time and time again that with true dedication you can learn even the hardest topics. Thank you for spending the time to bring new understanding to our group. Whenever you find something new in your study share your code in slack. Your work really helps our group progress.

<h2>Wyatt Ogden</h2>
<pre><code>- Chris Brookhart to Wyatt Ogden: 1 Above and Beyond.  Wyatt, I believeyou did a good job as team leader,including owning the responsibilityto make sure the team stayed on track and completed our work.  The advice I would give you is to have greater confidence in yourself.At times, you expressed concern that you weren't contributing as many insights and solutions as some others, but I feel your contributions were important and valuable.
- Wyatt Ogden to Wyatt Ogden: could possibly be a 3. Did a good job working with the team in class. Was able to draw connection between the actions of the different team members to move the project forward. Spent less time than I could have of solo work.
- Bretton Steiner to Wyatt Ogden: 2  Met Requirements. Wyatt, I think you did a good job at being our project manager for this case study, but if I could give you one piece of advice going forward, it would be to try to get our in class meetings on an agenda. Of course, you won't always be the project manager, but if you ever are again, I would suggest you use an agenda for the meetings so that we won't have any problem of missing anything or anyone.
- Jordan Watts to Wyatt Ogden: 1 Way to step up and be the first team lead! This was difficult for everyone but you really took initiative in guiding group conversations on zoom and slack.

<h2>Bretton Steiner</h2>
<pre><code>- Chris Brookhart to Bretton Steiner: 1Above and Beyond.  Bretton, I felt thatyou were the strongest contributor on our team for this assignment.  I appreciate your diligenceand your willingnessto help everyone.  I'm committed to provide some helpful advice to youat some point in thesemester, but I don't have anything right now.  I thought you did a great job.
- Wyatt Ogden to Bretton Steiner: 1 Great work, you did a great job being the 1st member of the team to start making some decision tree models and that helped the rest of the team out a lot to have that foundation to build upon. You had the best success of oversampling and that was another step where it helped the rest of us move the project forward.
- Bretton Steiner to Bretton Steiner: 1 Above and Beyond. Bretton, if I could give you one piece of advice going forward, it would be to try new things. You seem really focused and you really helped out the team by creating a model template for us to use in making our own models and in helping to drive our team meetings forward. You've been able to make models, but perhaps you should try new methods to analyze the data and to tune the model other than just adding and removing features.
- Jordan Watts to Bretton Steiner: 1 Your grasp of Python is exceptional. Thank you for asking questions whenever there is a term or function you are unfamiliar with. Your use and understanding of the heat map really helped our group.
- Bretton Steiner Total:    [1, 1, 1, 1]        (25 + 25 + 25 + 25) / 4 = **25**

<h2>Jordan Watts</h2>
<pre><code>- Chris Brookhart to Jordan Watts: 1 Above and Beyond.  Jordan, I feel you are a valuable member of the team and a contributor to the team.  The advice I would give you is to be more bold speaking up inour team meetings and on Slack.  Your personality seems to be a relatively quiet one, and as such, I suspect you might find it hard to share your viewpoints when others (like myself) tend to talk toomuch, but we need your thoughts and insights.  So, be bold!I'll try to be more cognizant of not takinguptoo much “airtime.”
- Wyatt Ogden to Jordan Watts: 2: you helped progress the project forward by having the best instance of get_dummies(). Continue to experiment with data analysis, we'll all learn how to use altair at a higher level. 
- Bretton Steiner to Jordan Watts: 3  Slightly Deficient. Jordan, if I could give you one piece of advice going forward, it would be to make your work known to the rest of the team. It might just be that you are extremely patient and waiting for your turn to speak, but it seemed like you wouldn't share your work with the team during meetings unless it was specifically asked of you. I think the team would be hindered if we didn't get to hear what you were able to work on.
- Jordan Watts to Jordan Watts: 2 Good work so far! Study the functions and topics used in each case study. If there is something that doesn't make, make sure to study it out after class and ask questions to the group. 
- Jordan Watts Total:   [1, 2, 3, 2]        (25 + 23.25 + 22 + 23.25) / 4 = **23.375**

<h2>Mars Biziyabal</h2>
<pre><code>- Mars Biziyabal to Mars Biziyabal: 3  Hey Mars, good job on creating graphs and giving us insight on the data. We love your contribution and would like it if you are more involved.
- Daniel Hernandez Giraldo to Mars Biziyabal: 2  Slightly deficient. He's good and he has made a good job with the predictive model, and I appreciate that he's always active in the Slack channel, but most of his visualizations were not helpful for the job. He should give more ideas and participate more in the meetings. But he's doing a great job.
- Jason Kent to Mars Biziyabal: 2 You did an awesome job this week, and the data you were able to provide was super helpful and contributed a lot to the final executive summary. One suggestion would be to maybe share a little more the thought processes you have, or how you reached some of your conclusions. 
- Chance Lopata to Mars Biziyabal: 2 : Don't be afraid to share your ideas, you had some good work and the team can benefit more from it.
- Keyanna Oliphant to Mars Biziyabal: 3 While I really like what you did with your visual graphs, it would be helpful if you were a bit more outgoing in the meetings.
- Tanner Layne Troumbley to Mars Biziyabal: 1. Mars was helpful in debugging code. Was always willing to look at it and gave helpful replies in Slack to questions asked. Participated in the team meetings and was willing to do whatever was asked of him. Created more graphs then needed and really digged into the data we had to understand it.
- Mars Biziyabal Total:     [3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1]      (22 + 23.25 + 23.25 + 23.25 + 22 + 25) / 6 = **23.125**

- Daniel Hernandez Giraldo to Daniel Hernandez Giraldo: 
- Jason Kent to Daniel Hernandez Giraldo: 2 I think you did a really good job, came up with some really good data and a great model. Your contributions to the group are always really good and help a lot. One suggestion would be to just maybe help out with team communication throughout the week.
- Chance Lopata to Daniel Hernandez Giraldo: 1 : Lets try to plan times that we meet to finish the case study ahead of time so that all members can be present.
- Keyanna Oliphant to Daniel Hernandez Giraldo: 1 Above and beyond: You went out of your way to help the group members by both answering questions that we had and giving us recommendations for code that would help us, great job!
- Tanner Layne Troumbley to Daniel Hernandez Giraldo: 1. Daniel managed to figure out a good way to clear the unknown values from the data. He then shared the method with the group. He was quick to respond in slack and was willing to help others with their code as needed. He was very involved in the group meetings. He helped the meeting be productive.
- Daniel Hernandez Giraldo Total:   [2, 2, 1, 1, None, 1]       (23.25 + 23.25 + 25 + 25 + 25) / 5 = **24.3**

- Daniel Hernandez Giraldo to Jason Kent: 3  Slightly deficient. He was present in some of the meetings, he shared some ideas, but most of the charts were not helpful for the project. I didn't have the opportunity to check his predictive model.
- Jason Kent to Jason Kent:  3 Jason, you did what you could, and you did a good job. I would just suggest maybe committing a little more time to the class and projects, not missing any meetings we may have, and all around trying to help with group communication so no one gets left behind.
- Chance Lopata to Jason Kent: 
- Keyanna Oliphant to Jason Kent:  2 All requirements met: You actively attended meetings and did good work on the graphs, good job!
- Tanner Layne Troumbley to Jason Kent: 1 Jason gave good graphs and did everything that Chance asked of him. He was willing to share his work and help others understand it during the team meetings. He asked questions when he didn't understand something which in turn deepened my understanding of the subjects. Would also share the way he solved his problems helping the group move on.

<h2>Chance Lopata</h2>
<pre><code>- Mars Biziyabal to Chance Lopata: 3  Hey Chance, good job on stepping up and leading the team. It was our first project and the flow of the projects seemed unclear at first and you took that for us. One thing I would suggest is make sure you go carefully through the module instructions. That would give us time to utilize our group discussions more effectively. 
- Daniel Hernandez Giraldo to Chance Lopata: 1 All requirements were met, and additional work was done. I think he made good contributions to the team and he was present in all the meetings, he dedicated a good time to the case study in and out of class.
- Jason Kent to Chance Lopata: 2 Leading a group is always tough, you did a really good job this week getting everything together and also presenting to the class. I would just suggest a little more communication over Slack to the team.
- Chance Lopata to Chance Lopata: 2 : I need to make sure I finish everything before our discussions, I failed to bring a model to our meeting (although I completed one after) so I was not able to use my model as we discussed our models.
- Keyanna Oliphant to Chance Lopata: 2 All requirements met: You did well as group leader this week, keep it up.
- Tanner Layne Troumbley to Chance Lopata:  2. Chance was a good leader. He took notes on what we talked about and was willing to answer any questions the team had. He was supportive of others ideas and never degraded someone. He also gave helpful insights to the data with some graphs.
- Chance Lopata Total:  [3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]      (22 + 25 + 23.25 + 23.25 + 23.25 + 23.25) / 6 = **23.3333**

<h2>Keyanna Oliphant</h2>
<pre><code>- Mars Biziyabal to Keyanna Oliphant: 3  Hey Keyanna, good job on creating graphs and giving us insight on the data. We love your contribution and would like it if you are more involved.
- Daniel Hernandez Giraldo to Keyanna Oliphant: 2  All requirements were met. She contributes with excellent ideas and good data visualizations. But she's not active in the Slack channel, so every time we need her to give an opinion or an idea about a certain visualization or idea in the Slack channel, she's not present. 
- Jason Kent to Keyanna Oliphant: 2 Great work, always there to help and have great insight to the conversation, learning, and projects. One suggestion would be maybe a bit more communication with the team throughout the week.
- Chance Lopata to Keyanna Oliphant:  2 : Towards the end of a case study try to let us know what days you would be free to meet for finishing the case study so that we can include your thoughts in the finished document.
- Keyanna Oliphant to Keyanna Oliphant: 3 I need to make sure I'm there for the presentation next time. I didn't realize we were supposed to present or I would've been there that day. However I did good work participating in the in class meetings.
- Tanner Layne Troumbley to Keyanna Oliphant: 2. Keyanna was very active in the team meetings. She answered questions and asked ones that helped us understand what was going on. Gave good insights into the data and was willing to answer questions about her code as needed.

- Jason Kent to Tanner Layne Troumbley: 2 Very good work all around, in your model, and help with the executive summary. The only suggestion I would give would be to help out with more communication with the group on expectations and any other things we may need.
- Chance Lopata to Tanner Layne Troumbley: 2 : Try not to plan anything during the meeting time so that you do not have to leave it early.
- Keyanna Oliphant to Tanner Layne Troumbley: 2 Your work on the graph and the model were good, but you could work on being a more active participant in our in class group meetings.

<h2>Colin Dye</h2>
<pre><code>- Colin Dye to Colin Dye:  3 A suggestion for my own improvement is to try to internalize the methods of machine learning that we are implementing in python, so I don't have to keep looking back at the resources.
- Trevor Neri to Colin Dye: (2)  Great Effort. Colin, I believe you did a great job on taking on the role of team lead. You did a good job of sticking it through and making sure that we had roles. I gave this score—and for everyone—because we all did miss on pointing out that there was more to the project.
- JP Parraga to Colin Dye: 2 All Requirements met. Colin, you did amazing as a project manager. If I could give you one piece of advice going forward, it would be to talk more about your code. I feel like you have great things to add and your code can benefit us a lot.
- Ivy Skousen to Colin Dye:  1 Great job leading the presentation on Monday, Colin. You have the confidence that this team needs, and you definitely show it. Thanks for leading the team this week.
- Madeline Woodard to Colin Dye: 2 Met requirements. I know being the first one to be team lead was intimidating and slightly more time consuming. I felt like you did well approaching this. Allowing us to work while still trying to direct us. You also contributed helpful information to the report and machine learning model. A suggestion for next time is you could spend more time trying different models.
- Colin Dye Total:  [3, (2), 2, 2, 2]       (22 + 23.25 + 23.25 + 23.25 + 23.25) / 5 = **23**

<h2>Trevor Neri</h2>
<pre><code>- Colin Dye to Trevor Neri: 2 Trevor you are probably the most well suited to be PM on the team as you communicate well and nicely with the team. I think you can get us on track when we are straying from the task at hand. I would welcome that if you felt the need to refocus the group. 
- Trevor Neri to Trevor Neri: (3)  Fair Effort. Trevor, you definitely did a good job too but my advice to you would be to make sure to do the readings and get on the level of the group. Your contributions in helping to drive for the group and helping others will not be forgotten, but you need to make sure to put in the time necessary to make even better contributions.
- JP Parraga to Trevor Neri: 2 All requirements were met. Trevor, your insights were really awesome. If I could give you one piece of advice going forward, it would be to remind us more often to stay on track. I feel like you're really good at telling us to not forget about something. Maybe you could drive us on time and always make sure that were moving fast.
- Ivy Skousen to Trevor Neri: 1 Trevor, thank you for asking all the hard questions. There were questions that you asked that I did not quite understand as well, so keep asking those questions. They really benefit the whole group and ensure that we all understand the material.
- Madeline Woodard to Trevor Neri: 4 Significantly Deficient. Trevor, the piece of advice I would give is come to the meetings more prepared. It is important to do the reading before the project and truly understand what the concepts are. This is all new to everyone and I understand the concepts are difficult, but I felt like you were ill prepared. But I know you already recognized this and will be more prepared for the next project. Second, the one task you volunteered to complete outside of class, you failed to do so. However, you asked good questions helping everyone gain deeper understanding and knowledge while working on the project.

<h2>JP Parraga</h2>
<pre><code>- Colin Dye to JP Parraga:  2 JP you are by far one of the most skilled python coders on the team and it showed during the process. If I could make one suggestion it would be to make your voice heard more, we probably need to listen to you more too. 
- Trevor Neri to JP Parraga: (2)  Great Effort. JP, if I could give you advice, it is to keep going with your learning. You were the one to help us achieve the highest percent accuracy for the Machine Learning Model. The fact that you went out of your way to catch up with the group and go above and beyond with your learning shows everyone that you are contributing amazingly. 
- JP Parraga to JP Parraga: 3 I think I could've done a better job at going deeper into the features. I feel like I focused toomuch on the model building and getting a high accuracy scorewhereasI should've been focusing on communicating those results.I think I could've explored the data more and produce better graphics.
- Ivy Skousen to JP Parraga: : 1 JP, you contributed to the team in so many ways this project. Sharing your ideas, showing up in meetings, making the Jupyter Gist for the summary. Thanks for all of your hard work! 
- Madeline Woodard to JP Parraga:  1 Met All requirements and Completed Additional. You truly went above and beyond. I know you spent a lot of time outside of class working on the model. We already had a good model at 94 percent but you wanted to see if you could improve it further which you did. It was also apparent when answering questions and providing ideas that you had a clear understanding of the concepts.

<h2>Ivy Skousen</h2>
<pre><code>- Colin Dye to Ivy Skousen: 2 Ivy your inquisitive nature helped us fill the gap in many questions and data analysis. I do not have any pressing suggestions but any more communication you can provide to the team when you have a question, or a concern would be great. 
- Trevor Neri to Ivy Skousen: (2)  Great Effort. I know that you felt very inadequate at first, but I am happy to see you continuing on trying and being able to figure out how to do under sampling on your own. Please don't be afraid to ask for help in the group. We are here to support and help each other.
- JP Parraga to Ivy Skousen: 2 All requirements were met. Ivy, you're a great team member. If I could give you one piece advice going forward, it would be to share more of your visualizations that you made and explain more why that visual is important. Data analysis through your visualizations can greatly help our team.
- Ivy Skousen to Ivy Skousen:  1 Ivy, thank you for giving the example in the summary for the undersampling. Your input and questions are valuable to the team, so keep on speaking up in the team meetings.
- Madeline Woodard to Ivy Skousen: 2 Requirements Were Met. You were helpful and tried some models on your own. You showed up and completed the work to the best of your ability and seemed to have a good understanding of the concepts. But I didn't feel like you did anything to go truly above and beyond.

<h2>Madeline Woodard</h2>
<pre><code>- Colin Dye to Madeline Woodard: 2 Madeline you are definitely one of the most skilled python programmers on the team and my one suggestion would be to speak up more because we probably need your insight. 
- Trevor Neri to Madeline Woodard: (2) Great Effort. Madeline you are the MVP! You were the first one to figure out how to get our Machine Learning Model above %90. We all still owe you a lollipop. You had amazing contributions to the group. Please do not be afraid to share your opinion in the group Your voice matters and we want to hear it!
- JP Parraga to Madeline Woodard: 1All requirements were met, and additional work was done. Thank you for showing us how to implement the RandomOverSampler(). If I could give you one piece of advice going forward, it would be to explain your thought process and the explanation behind your code. You are a great programmer.
- Ivy Skousen to Madeline Woodard: 2  Madeline, you are clearly very intelligent and understand a lot of this material. We miss a lot of ideas or information when you do not speak up in our meetings, or do not show up. You contributed so much for this project, so when you do not show up to our meetings or share your ideas, the whole team misses out. Please share more of your ideas because they really move the team forward just like they did on this project. 
- Madeline Woodard to Madeline Woodard: 2 Met Requirements. Had great understanding of the model was the first one to get a model with an accuracy over 90 percent. Spent time outside of class working on model but using only the information provided. Could try learning beyond the immediate information given.

- Porter McGary to Joshua Bee: 1 Above and beyond: Joshua you did an excellent job taking the lead in this project and making a conscious effort to find out more and push the limits where you saw fit.
- Nathan Prestwich to Joshua Bee: 1  I was appreciative of you sharing your screen and letting us see how you came to the conclusions you did.
- Kiersten Schill to Joshua Bee: 2 I felt you were a great lead! To be honest, nothing really stands out to me about what you should improve on... sorry! Thank you for assigning parts to the project, I think that was a smart move!
- Aubrey Shuga to Joshua Bee: 4 Significantly Deficient. Josh, I would suggest that you work on understanding what the client is asking and how to best present our findings to them in an actionable way, rather than just taking all of their questions literally. You seem to have a good understanding of decision trees and how our model works, but the client needs an actionable report that will help them to build their campaign. Your section on the summary didn't really seem helpful to the client at all.

<h2>Cameron Lyman</h2>
<pre><code>- Joshua Bee to Cameron Lyman: 2  Could have used more visuals for explanation, but otherwise met the requirements. 
- Cameron Lyman to Cameron Lyman: 4. Has some understanding but needs improvement on team communication and finding solutions on his own.
- Porter McGary to Cameron Lyman: 2 Met Requirements: Cameron, your questions and point of views were unmistakably important. Without your questions and angles on the project we would have forgotten a lot of important points that lead our project in the right direction.
- Nathan Prestwich to Cameron Lyman: 2  In the meetings it seems like you are doing something separate and occasionally popping in to catch us up to where you are. I would appreciate a more active approach, driving the coding at times or working on the code of whoever is driving directly.
- Kiersten Schill to Cameron Lyman: 2 I felt like you had some smart insights throughout the projects which really benefited the team, but it would have been even better if we got to hear those insights/explanations more!
- Aubrey Shuga to Cameron Lyman: 3  Slightly Deficient. Cameron, I would suggest that you speak up more during our team meetings. You often shared helpful insights or tips, but sometimes it seemed like you waited to share them until we are really struggling. I've noticed you speaking up more often each time we meet, so please continue to do that! I would also suggest considering how to best present our work to the client. It is one thing to create a model with a high accuracy, but our client needs us to share the results in an actionable way so they can use them to build a plan.

<pre><code>- Joshua Bee to Porter McGary: 2  You did a good job at what you were assigned, but there is always room to go above and beyond, you can improve on asking more questions in meetings.
- Cameron Lyman to Porter McGary: 2. Could have followed up better with teammates to make sure that they were studying and doing what they were supposed to.
- Porter McGary to Porter McGary: 2 Met Requirements: Porter, you were on time to all meetings and had good valuable input when needed and got all your parts and pieces done on time and in an orderly fashion.
- Nathan Prestwich to Porter McGary: 1 Your code helped me to figure out exactly what to do, so I appreciate your willingness to share.
- Kiersten Schill to Porter McGary: 2 I loved the energy that you brought to the project, I know you contributed because we had assigned parts, but I would have loved to hear from you more! 
- Aubrey Shuga to Porter McGary: 2  All requirements were met. Porter, I think you did a great job showing the customer how the contact frequency affects the results in way that is compelling and easy to understand. Moving forward, I would suggest including some conclusions  you explained what happened in the past, now tell them what they should do in the future. I would also suggest finding ways to go above and beyond what the client specifically asked of us, such as interesting interactions or other insights that would be helpful to the client.
- Porter McGary Total:  [2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2]      (23.25 + 23.25 + 23.25 + 25 + 23.25 + 23.25) / 6 = **23.5417**

<h2>Nathan Prestwich</h2>
<pre><code>- Joshua Bee to Nathan Prestwich: 2  Found out the decisive data points, which is very important to know about as a company, could have used just a little bit more content. I noticed there was some before we turned it in, but it was code, which may not have been appropriate for sharing findings with the business. 
- Cameron Lyman to Nathan Prestwich: 1. Went above and beyond with answering questions and making graphs.
- Porter McGary to Nathan Prestwich: 1 Above and Beyond: Nathan you did a great job leading the effort and making graphs and charts and the initial analytics look amazing without you it would have been much harder for me to understand the where, what, and how's of this project. 
- Nathan Prestwich to Nathan Prestwich: 1 I feel like I did all that was asked of me, though I could do it earlier, so there isn't as much of a crunch near the end.
- Kiersten Schill to Nathan Prestwich: 2 I thought you provided great insights to the project. But I noticed there were times when it seemed you weren't open to other ideas or tried to understand better.
- Aubrey Shuga to Nathan Prestwich: 2  All requirements were met. I would suggest that you find ways to go above and beyond the main requirements of our case study. It seemed like you had a good understanding of the case study and of decision trees, so it would have been nice to include some additional insights into the data on our report, rather than just an explanation of the model and its top features.

- Cameron Lyman to Kiersten Schill: 2 Met the requirements.
- Porter McGary to Kiersten Schill: 2 Met Requirements: Kiersten, you did a fabulous job and always had great comments questions that helped to steer the conversation in directions we needed to go during our meetings. You did a great job at getting your work done and making it look professional.
- Nathan Prestwich to Kiersten Schill: 2  I never got to see any of the code you were working on, so it made it hard to know exactly what you had been doing.
- Kiersten Schill to Kiersten Schill: 4 I missed the first meeting which made me feel really behind on everything. Aubrey did a great job on catching me up, but I didn't really feel connected with the team, partly because I think because I missed the first day of project meetings. I also didn't speak up a ton in our meetings, and when I did, I didn't know how to intelligently explain myself. I had a really good idea for making weighted medians and modes... but alas, I didn't know how to explain myself. While Aubrey and I worked together on the graphics, I was on a time crunch because I had plans and we waited till the last minute. She did all the coding for the graphics, but we did talk about the concepts of them together.
- Aubrey Shuga to Kiersten Schill: 3 Slightly Deficient. Moving forward, I would suggest that you contribute more in our team meetings. You have good insights into the data and can see important things that some of the other team members overlook or don't understand. Especially if you need to miss part or all of a meeting, make sure that when you are there you are participating. I think our team could have really benefitted from your experience.

<h2>Aubrey Shuga</h2>
<pre><code>- Joshua Bee to Aubrey Shuga: 1 You found a great set of actionable patterns, outside of normal things thought about, the only point to improve on would be the timing, as you did not complete the assignment until the final hour. 
- Cameron Lyman to Aubrey Shuga: 2 Met the requirements. 
- Porter McGary to Aubrey Shuga: 2 Met Requirements: Aubrey, you did a fantastic job staying in contact and always responding to slack quickly. I knew that if a member of the team needed a question answered or direction you could easily provide it and quickly as well.
- Nathan Prestwich to Aubrey Shuga: 2  I would like it if you shared your code/work more often so we could all make sure we are all on the same page.
- Kiersten Schill to Aubrey Shuga: 1 You did awesome on the graphics and I felt like you really understood the end goal of the project. You also were awesome on keeping everyone on track and making sure everyone was on the same page, so it was kind of a bummer when you showed up late. Moving forward, I think it would be good if you showed up on time! :)
- Aubrey Shuga to Aubrey Shuga: 2  All requirements were met. Going forward, I would suggest to myself to talk to the team about how we structured our executive summary. I was unhappy with our final deliverable, so I should have discussed that with my team early on. I would also suggest that I should focus on roughly completing all the parts of my assigned task before spending time perfecting individual parts. It's better to have more to show the client than only one thing to show them that looks nice.

<h2>Jackson Dial</h2>
<pre><code>- Jackson Dial to Jackson Dial:  1 Above and Beyond. I feel that I really did my best to contribute to the project. I used my specialized skills whenever possible, while also being open to any new skills or ideas that I was faced with. An improvement for myself is to be more prepared for the presentation. I did not adequately prepare to lead the presentation, and was only confidently familiar with my own sections of the presentation.
- Hunter Livesay to Jackson Dial: 1  You were an amazing team lead this module! Thank you for keeping us on track to getting thesummary finished ahead of schedule. You also did a great job at keeping us focused on  the objectives set out in the assignment. I think if you spent more time considering the actual needsof the company than our objectives would be more obvious as well.
- Danny Moon to Jackson Dial:  1  Even if you did not understand every details of the model, you did great job encouraging other team members with finishing their task as a project leader. Keep participating and give us great ideas.
- Conner Pohlsander to Jackson Dial:  2  All requirements met. Like I've written down for the other members of our group, communication is key. I think moving forward our whole group efforts will improved if we are better at communicating about what each of us should do.

<h2>Hunter Livesay</h2>
<pre><code>- Jackson Dial to Hunter Livesay: 1 Above and Beyond. Hunter, if I could give you a 0 I would. You could've done this whole project by yourself and possibly even quicker. Despite you knowing a lot more about ML than everyone in the group, you were really willing to share what you know and help us understand, which is an important part of a team dynamic. Really the only thing that I could give as an improvement is talk slower when you are explaining things sometimes. Great job!
- Hunter Livesay to Hunter Livesay: 1  You learned a lot in this module and it was amazing to see your growth. It's clear you have asolid understanding of the math and algorithms. Consider spending more time reading therequirements and exploring the data.
- Danny Moon to Hunter Livesay: 1  You did really great with this module. You were on top of everything and great job with researching on oversampling. Your model performed the best and I would like to keep seeing that.
- Conner Pohlsander to Hunter Livesay: 1 Above and Beyond. I think you did amazing with this project and did more with our model than what was required. The only piece of advice I have at this time is that more communication about how you were able to figure out how to make improvements on the project would be very helpful.

<h2>Danny Moon</h2>
<pre><code>- Jackson Dial to Danny Moon: 1 Above and Beyond. Danny, you were very helpful and knowledgeable about every aspect of the project. You helped with building the model, with the analytical side of the presentation, and with making sure we had every question answered. One improvement would be to try to say more in the presentation, though there wasn't really much of an opportunity for you to.
- Hunter Livesay to Danny Moon: Danny 1  Amazing work this module! I loved getting to work with you on this project. Your insights intothe data itself were invaluable. It's clear that you have a good understanding of the algorithmsused. For future modules I think you'll understand the assignments better if you spend moretime reading the requirements.
- Danny Moon to Danny Moon: 1  I taught my team members how the decision tree doesn't like quantitative values when making a decision. Also, I found out a method that shows the score of each feature that shows the importance in the model. Keep kind a way to improve your model with your team.
- Conner Pohlsander to Danny Moon: 2  All requirements met. I think the only piece of advice I would give is that more communication about the module we are working on would be great. This is advice I am giving to all of our team members including myself.

<h2>Conner Pohlsander</h2>
<pre><code>- Jackson Dial to Conner Pohlsander: 1 Above and beyond. Conner, you did everything you could to help the team, and everything that was asked/assigned of you. You really went in depth with what you knew how to do, particularly with the initial exploration, and that is all we could ask for as a team! One way to improve is to try to talk more in the presentation (though I know we were caught rather off guard, so it was a bit difficult).
- Hunter Livesay to Conner Pohlsander: 1  Amazing work this module! Your data visualizations were amazing. Thank you for sharing yourtechniques and knowledge about how to convey the data in a meaningful way. I think that ifyou spent some time experimenting with the techniques on your own, then you would have aneven better understanding of the algorithms we used in this module.
- Danny Moon to Conner Pohlsander: 1  You did a great job with doing your part in the module. You found your best way to make charts for the module. I appreciate your input and effort.
- Conner Pohlsander to Conner Pohlsander: 2  All requirements met. The biggest thing I can do moving forward is making sure I am on the same page as everyone else and being more prepared for meetings. I feel like I wasn't very prepared for our first meeting, but did much better in the other meetings we had.

<h2>Ethan Nelson</h2>
<pre><code>- Ethan Nelson to Ethan Nelson: 3 I contributed, but not as much as I could have. I feel that while I did take part in the creation of decision trees including our final tree, I didn't have as much of an understanding as I should have. Next time I will need to spend more time working on the assignment, as well as more time reading about the background of the assignment so I have a better understanding of the project as a whole.
- Trey Walker to Ethan Nelson: 2  You did a fantastic job helping to visualize the information we were working with. That was incredibly helpful at the start of the week. One thing I'd say could be worked on was just communication in our first planning meeting. It was a little unclear if the weekend assignments we had were fully understood beforehand, so just double checking and participating more in the conversation would be very welcome.
- Tim Womble to Ethan Nelson:  2  I would only suggest that you try to communicate a bit better with the rest of the team (all 2 of us). Sometimes during meetings you just started working away without saying much, which kind of makes the team meetings pointless. Otherwise, you made some solid contributions and did well with the data analysis.

<h2>Trey Walker</h2>
<pre><code>- Ethan Nelson to Trey Walker: 2 You did well. You clearly understood the problem, and were able to make many effective attempts to bring us closer to a solution. If I had to suggest something (which I do) it would be to have more communication in between class.
- Trey Walker to Trey Walker: 2  You did a great job working to find new solutions in meetings throughout the project. Make sure to be a little more proactive in between classes as well, it would be helpful if you could bring some more to the table each meeting.
- Tim Womble to Trey Walker: 2  Once you got on track, you did a good job of analyzing the data and understanding feature relationships. You also contributed well to our team meetings and brought out some great points. Just make sure you follow through on whatever team assignments you agree to.

<h2>Tim Womble</h2>
<pre><code>- Ethan Nelson to Tim Womble: 1 You were the best at refining our decision tree. You had the idea of oversampling, and were able to make it happen. One suggestion I had (this goes for the whole group) is to have more communication between class. Communication in the slack channel about things relevant to the project. Things like methods we have found ineffective, discoveries or progress we have made, and so on. 
- Trey Walker to Tim Womble: 1 Tim, you rocked at both understanding the data well ahead of time and discovering new methods to create the model. You did a great job managing everybody as a PM. I honestly don't have any suggestions to improve, just keep up the awesome work.
- Tim Womble to Tim Womble:  2  I am going to work on understanding the material better before getting started so I know better what to try with the data and model(s). I feel like I pulled my weight in the team (and also did okay as team leader), but only just. Certainly it took me a while to figure out just what I was doing.

<h2>Jordan Carlson</h2>
<pre><code>- Jordan Carlson to Jordan Carlson: 1, Great job at understanding the data and practicing new analytic skills. Problem solving was great to understand which indicators were important to the model and deciding how to present the data. Good communication skills to keep the team on track and make sure everyone was supportive of each other. Could work more on sanitizing/preparing data. 
- Kyle Mueller to Jordan Carlson: 1 Above and Beyond. Jordan, you were an essential member of our team. You provided many useful and unique insights on the data that helped lead our team to success, and I'm grateful for your diligence and your contributions to the project. The only advice I would give you is to come to the status meetings more prepared. We are all busy guys, but we should all try to work outside of class and be ready for the status meetings. We should try to get more work done earlier on in the project so we don't have to rush to get everything done at the last minute. We could all do better at this, and I personally guarantee that this will be something that I will work on.
- Cody Overholt to Jordan Carlson: 2  You worked hard to get yourself up to speed with the things you didn't understand. Your feedback and questions helped drive the project forward.

Did a lot of great work that helped the whole team understand the purpose of the assignment. I seriously can't think of anything to improve upon, you are working in the right direction and learning just like we all are but also setting a great example.
- Kyle Mueller to Kyle Mueller: Kyle: 1 Above and Beyond. I did very well and worked extremely hard on this project. I created the model, doctored up the executive summary, and wrote the conclusion. However, I need to focus on learning more about and implementing some of the more difficult concepts taught in this class. I am new to data science, and at times I struggle to understand the material. Notwithstanding, I need to push myself to learn as much as possible so I can continue to be successful in this class. I also need to be better at not procrastinating and trying to get more work done between classes so we don't have to rush at the last minute.
- Cody Overholt to Kyle Mueller:  1 You showed great initiative when it came to getting the ball rolling on the project. Your initiative with getting graphs started and making the machine learning model done helped immensely.

- Ricardo Leon Coronado to Rachel Joan Chang: 2  You are so spot on in all our meetings and your insights are great. If I could give you one piece of feedback, it would be to communicate your findings as you are working on the processes, that way everyone in the team can help you if you have any questions or get stuck.
- Josh Nestman to Rachel Joan Chang: 2  All requirements met. You were the most productive member of our team. Great work ethic and dedication to the assignment. Solid stuff and I really have no complaints. As suggestions are expected to be made, all I would recommend would be solid communication with the rest of the team. As a whole, I felt our team did great but there were times when it felt like everyone was doing their own thing and didn't really know what the others were working on.

- Catie Holloway to Catie Holloway: 1 Above and Beyond. I worked during and outside of class to contribute at least 10 hours to this project. As the project lead, I organized our team by assigning everyone tasks to complete for the upcoming class period. I wanted to make sure everyone's contributions mattered and were used in the final project. I found a time to zoom, where we could all meet to write up conclusions. I created Decision tree algorithms as well as graphs. When I didn't understand concepts, I researched them and asked questions to get a better grasp on the material. We all kept each other in the loop on Slack, and posted our findings.
- Ricardo Leon Coronado to Catie Holloway: 1  You did a wonderful job conducting the team and the meetings. If I could give you one piece of feedback, it would be to perhaps delegate a bit more some tasks among the team.
- Josh Nestman to Catie Holloway: 2  All requirements were met. You were a great team lead for this section Catie, great work. You worked exceptionally hard to make sure all of the requirements were taken care of and you had great communication outside of class. Since suggestions are expected to be made, all I would recommend would be more specific assignments to the team members to handle as individuals. Sometimes I felt that we were all doing our own thing and weren't on the same page as a group. It's a small suggestion really, all in all you did great.

- Ricardo Leon Coronado to Ricardo Leon Coronado: 3 Great job, Ricardo! I know you are trying hard in this class. If I could give you a piece of feedback it would be to work on the assignment before it even starts so you can gain more confidence that you are leveled up with the rest of the team.
- Josh Nestman to Ricardo Leon Coronado: 2  All requirements met. You did a lot of the leg work when it came to analysing the data we were provided. Your insights really helped the group understand what correlations to look into and ultimately made our model much better in the long run. My one suggestion, since one needs to be made for this assignment, would be punctuality for our class meetings. It's a really petty suggestion but I'll make it just because it's expected to be made. Overall you did great work and I have no real complaints for your contributions to the group.

This allowed an easy way to know what to do and plenty of time to work on it. 
- Asher Hanson to James Alves da silva: 1  James, I really admired your way of using your knowledge of technology to help keep us organized and united.  As a student, I can tell you are interested in learning and doing well.  I think that if you could have brought more graphs or insight to each class meeting that would have been helpful.Sometimes it was hard when we all didn't have any work to show each other each time we met.  But thanks for your perseverance and leadership.
- Ellie Perkins to James Alves da silva: 2  I thought you did a great job making sure we stayed on track for due dates as the team leader. You spent extra time sending us documentations and setting up a platform for us to use for our summary. We were a little freaked out when you were late that one meeting, but as long as you tell us know next time when you think you might be late, I believe that would help.

Despite the miscommunication, he contributed to the project and went above and beyond making the website for the presentation. 
- Asher Hanson to Gabriel Sanahuano Castrillon: 2  It was great having you on our team because of the passionyou had with producing our website summary (which looks great!).  It would have been great though if while we were working on the project, you had come to class with some graphs/models ready to share.  Sometimes it was hard when we all didn't have any work to show each other when we met for class.  And since the projects are going to get harder and harder, we are going to need everyone working as much as possible.  
- Ellie Perkins to Gabriel Sanahuano Castrillon: 2  Nice work on the website! It looked great. I know you tried really hard to participate even though you were quarantined for some of the project and it showed in your work. The day you didn't tell us you had something going on at home was a little hard for the group to work with since it was the last day before the executive summary was due. Things happen, and I totally get that, but let us know before the meeting when something comes up so we can plan for it a little better.

<h2>Trevor Fernstrom</h2>
<pre><code>- Trevor Fernstrom to Trevor Fernstrom: 1 I think that one thing that could be done is trying making more models and different types of models. Not just doing a one and done type of process. 
- Ilya Kovalyov to Trevor Fernstrom: 1  Above and beyond. Thank you so much for teaching me about how to use Python and Aba Boost. It helped me to learn and helped me to contribute to the project. Your financial experience helped me understand some of the key points of the dataset and I believe it is your rewardthat we finished the project on time. Keep up the good work!
- Andrew Lundgren to Trevor Fernstrom: 1 Above and Beyond. I think that you made some great contributions to the team, especially by sharing your background knowledge about the features we were working with. You were always on time and had great models. If I had one piece of feedback to share, it would be to use some of your understanding to improve models that come from other teammates. I think you have a strong grasp on what is going on in the class so far, and it would be beneficial to our team if you shared some of that knowledge by helping others improve their models.

<h2>Ilya Kovalyov</h2>
<pre><code>- Trevor Fernstrom to Ilya Kovalyov: 1  ILYA, I think that you did great in contributing as much as you could to the model and discussion. I think that one suggestion that I have for you is to try and understand the model that we are studying better so that it will be easier to follow along.
- Ilya Kovalyov to Ilya Kovalyov: 2. All requirements were met.I tried understanding everything, but it took too long (and still is taking long). I did not organize the team effort as I should have, thus we do not have the best of what we could have had.I put up the final document and finally organized the team work to have the project done. Even though our model is not perfect (I think it is far from perfect), we learned how to work as a team. Also, we successfully handled a team member who decided to quit without letting us know. 
- Andrew Lundgren to Ilya Kovalyov: 1 Above and Beyond. I think that you did a great job with developing the models you shared and that you did your best to understand the problem. You showed initiative in helping the team get the document written and helping others to understand the context of our problem. If I had one piece of feedback to share, it would be to help reach out to include teammates who are not participating as much. I think that you have a very friendly personality that can help some of our team that may be a little quiet or shy to open up and share more of their ideas.
- Adam White to Ilya Kovalyov: 2 You did a great job again as team leader, the only suggestion I would make would to be more decisive.

<h2>Andrew Lundgren</h2>
<pre><code>- Trevor Fernstrom to Andrew Lundgren: 1 Andrew, I thought that you did great and did everything that was asked by you. 
- Ilya Kovalyov to Andrew Lundgren: 1  Above and beyond.Thank you, Andrew, for always giving different ideas about how to explore data and what to do with it to make it look nicer. Just keep doing the good work and we will be very successful!
- Andrew Lundgren to Andrew Lundgren: 1 Above and Beyond. I think that you did an excellent job communicating with the team and trying to help others understand the case study. You made many models and shared them, along with other insights about the data, with the team. A way that you could improve would be to try and work closely with other team members to create the models. By working as a team to make models, I think it will help all of us understand how the models are made and why we decide to create one model in a way that differs from another.

<h2>Adam White</h2>
<pre><code>- Trevor Fernstrom to Adam White: 1 Adam, I think that you did great and added to the discussion and task that we had to complete. 
- Ilya Kovalyov to Adam White: 1  Above and beyond. Adam, you always helped throughout this project and contributed to our discussions. You helped us answer one of the three questions. I would suggest before you share a Google Doc with someone, check in an incognito window to make sure it is accessible because I could not access the last file you said (because I did it too late) and could not reach you because it was too late. It was my fault mostly but make sure you test the files before you send them out. Besides that, great job!
- Andrew Lundgren to Adam White: 2  All requirements were met. I think that you did a great job sharing your insights and finding key parts of the data to improve our models. Some feedback would be to try and check the Slack channel more often. We are not always communicating on the channel, but towards the end of this last case study it would have helped to have a little more contact with you. Another piece of advice would be to not become fixated on one feature of the data. Your insight into the feature about numbers of contacts and the time of contact was excellent and helped us to improve our models quite a bit. I think, however, that you may have focused a little too hard on it. If you apply the same analytical skills to more features without quite as much specialization, I think you will make several vital contributions to our team moving forward. Keep up the good work!
- Adam White to Adam White: 3 Speak up more so that you can ensure that you are assigned enough to make a sufficient and significant contribution. Also, writing out the code from scratch may help.

# Grade Notes
## Team 2
I can not set individual scores for the executive summary and therefore people of the former team two will receive the higher of the two grades from their teams.

## Team 4:
Alfredo graded a couple of people very harshly, and overall these grades are weird a bit.

## Team 9:
Aubrey graded Josh significantly harder than anyone else did, also Cameron and Kiersten graded themselves quite harshly.

## Team 10: 
Connor graded everyone including the team performance much harder than anyone else.

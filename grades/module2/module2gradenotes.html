<h1>Grade Notes</h1>
<h2>Team 2</h2>
<p>I can not set individual scores for the executive summary and therefore people of the former team two will receive the higher of the two grades from their teams.</p>
<h2>Team 4:</h2>
<p>Alfredo graded a couple of people very harshly, and overall these grades are weird a bit.</p>
<h2>Team 9:</h2>
<p>Aubrey graded Josh significantly harder than anyone else did, also Cameron and Kiersten graded themselves quite harshly.</p>
<h2>Team 10:</h2>
<p>Connor graded everyone including the team performance much harder than anyone else.</p>

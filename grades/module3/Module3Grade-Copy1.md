## Riley Dixon
### Candor Comments:
	- 2. I created several machine learning models that helped us make different inferences from the data and made some very helpful graphs. However I a little unavailable at some times during the week.
	- 2. You are super smart and put a lot of effort into the model and it showed. You are super inclusive as well.
	- 2. You had some great ideas on how to bin the data to get better insights to different price brackets.
	- 2. The ideas you had for things like binning the data and modifying it with out making it incorrect or inaccurate helped a lot. My advice I would give is to be willing to explain your thinking more but in a simple manner when the opportunities arise. That way all of us can follow along with your thinking and process.
	- 2. Your model was awesome and really helped the team! I was really happy with the work we were able to do in this case study! The only thing I have is to have everything ready on time Saturday or earlier, both case studies seemed to be in a little late. Great work this week!
	- (1). above and beyond. Riley, your improvements to the module really helped our project progress this week. Thank you for all your hard work.

## Anika Grundvig
### Candor Comments:
	- 2. You were a great help especially when it came to creating charts and helping us understand the machine learning model.
	- 2. You did good at putting in effort to understand the model and make things better. I am also proud of you for contributing in the intimidating group.
	- 2. Your insights into the data was invaluable to the team.
	- 3. It is difficult to get used to a new team. My advice would be to speak up more. It seems that you have a good knowledge of python and its libraries and the libraries relevant to machine learning. It doesn’t do anyone any good, besides you, if it stays bottled up in the noggin.
	- 1. Really good wok this week Anika, you and Holly were great additions to our team. I thought you did well finding ways to help and making graphs and explanations that were helpful. I know it might have been hard to get a word in, but your voice is definitely heard! Great work this week.
	- (2). all requirements met. Anika, you did amazing work this week! I loved all of your contributions and felt like you really contributed to the team.

## Jeremy Jones
### Candor Comments:
	- 2. You are crazy good at Python and so nice about answering everyone else’s questions. 
	- 1. You were able to teach us all about the machine learning model and help us understand what we needed to do to achieve the desired results.
	- 2. Try to get more involved into how to manipulate the data beforejumping into the model.
	- 2. You had great idea for graphing the information in order to help develop our model(s). My advice would be to share your knowledge more.
	- 1. Awesome work this week Jeremy! All your graphs and code were fantastic and really helped the team. Good work helping everyone on the group too and explaining your code with everyone! Great work this week!
	- (1). above and beyond. Jeremy, your contributions really showed this week and it really helped our project move along quickly.

## Isaac Malmstrom
### Candor Comments:
	- 2. Great work this week you helped contribute to machine learning and graphs.
	- 2. You are super smart and good at looking at the data in different angles that we may not have thought of.
	- 2. You had great ideas about why data points were behaving in certain ways that we didn’t have in the actual data set. 
	- 2. While I am still learning how to utilize the machine learning libraries more, I was giving a lot more of an effort in expressing what kind of graphs we could use, what type of functions we should use like RMSE or MSE for building our model. I also tried to offer things like graph interpretations, since the data was concerning properties in the Seattle area, and I am from the Seattle area myself.
	- 1. Your technical skills in the executive summary is really helpful. I know that you struggle a little bit with the python coding, but you make up for it everywhere you an which is very helpful. Great work this week.
	- (2). all requirements met. Isaac, you did great work this week. I felt like you really contributed to this team.

## Josh Peterson
### Candor Comments:
	- 1. You went above and beyond as our team leader making sure we were all doing something productive and ensuring that our executive summary had the best possible models and graphs.
	- 2. I think you were seriously an excellent team leader. You kept us all on track and you made sure we all had something to do and that we all got to show our progress. I was very impressed.
	- 2. You did a great job getting the response document prepped for the team, maybe have a plan for presenting if we end up needing to present.
	- 2. It is hard to do a 1 performance but you did a great job making it clear what jobs we needed to do, and what we needed to do in order to progress. My advice for improvement would be to make the goals/jobs a little more clear.
	- 1. I felt like I earned a 1 this week. I worked really hard figuring out python coding and making a model and I felt like a did a good job as team leader. I was able to organize and direct the team to a common goal. 
	- (1). above and beyond. Josh, you were a great PM to our team. You kept us on task and had great expectations for each individual person.

## Holly VanAuker
### Candor Comments:
	- 2. You helped with the graphs and machine learning model and made an effort to be present in our meeting even though you weren’t able to be there in person.
	- 2. You were good at supporting everyone’s ideas and putting in some good input.
	- 2. Your graph showing price, grade, and condition was great. You hadsome great comparisons of the data that taught us about this dataset.
	- 3. It is hard to acclimate to a new team and figure out the overall flow. So the only advice I want to give is to put yourself out there more. Nothing out of normal for you. That way we also get used to you too and understand how you operate. It’ll help get things smoothed out quicker. 
	- 2. Good work this week Holly! You and Anika both were great new additions to the team. Good work with figuring out the model and coding, I know it is difficult, but this week you were able to figure out and learn how to help our team succeed. Good work!
	- 3. Slightly Deficient. Holly, I felt like you did so much better with your work. However, I do not feel like you have completed the all requirements met category. Please do your best to reach out to your teammates, and don’t be afraid to show everyone your mistakes.

## Reece Brown
### Candor Comments:
	- 3. Slightly Deficient. I definitely didn’t do my best this week and wasn’t putting nearly enough effort into the project. This week was hard for me, but I will do better next project.
	- 2. Reece, I am very impressed with your hard work, even when you have a lot of assignments and projects going on at the same time. If I could give you one piece of advice, it would be to ask for help if you are struggling. We are all here to help each other. 
	- 2- Reece seemed like he accomplished everything he was supposed to. I am not really sure if he did additional work if I knew for sure that he did I would rate him a 1. Improvement: If he did have any insights about the data I would have loved to hear them.

## John Cornelison
### Candor Comments:
	- 2. Good. John you did a good job this week. I didn’t really have much interaction with you, but you go all of your work done and on time.
	- 2. I gave my self a 2 because I didn’t go above and beyond the requirements. I did meet them all, and was able to answer the question from the housing company. I was able to figure out how to find the difference between the prediction and actual price of the house. It took a lot of time, but it was fun to get it done. I want to go above and beyond, but I am having a hard time figuring out what to do. I like the idea of creating away to implement it, such as being able to import data, but I am not willing to make the time for figuring that our right now. 
	- 2. It seemed that John did everything he was supposed to do. Honestly I am not really sure exactly what tasks he accomplished but he said he had everything done for the machine learning model. Improvement: This week I can’t really say anything about improvements mostly because our communication was not very good on what tasks people had done.

## Kaelan McGurk
### Candor Comments:
	- 1. Exceptional. Kaelan, you did a great job as team lead this time. You were able to keep everyone on track and really did a great job with the executive summary. I feel if you are a team lead in the future, however, you could do a little better on giving more definite deadlines and assignments. But overall you did a great job.
	- 1. Kaelan, great job on leading the team this week. This is the primary reason I gave you a 1. If I could give you one piece of advice it would be to ask more questions to the teammates. That way you can get a better idea of where we all are at. 
	- 2. This week Kaelan was our group leader and for the most part he did a good job at being our leader. He followed up with most people in our group from what I could tell. Improvement: I felt our meetings could have been ran a little more effectively with better communication. Our meetings mostly felt like work on project time instead of a team meeting. I didn’t really know what he had accomplished or what my teammates had accomplished during our meetings.

## Stephen Sharp
### Candor Comments:
	- 2. Good. Stephen, you did a great job this week. You got all of your work done and in a timely manner, and helped when help was needed.
	- 2. Stephen, I really like the graphic you made for the executive summary. It was very clear and informative. If I could give you one piece of advice, it would be to share with us new things that you learn. Either by sending messages in slack, or mentioning what you learn in our group meetings. 
	- 1. I know that Stephen did some additional work he showed me some of his code when I had a question. Improvement: Stephen is a really intelligent guy, I wish he would be more open about new idea’s he’s trying because It would help me see the data from a different perspective. At the meetings he could talk about new things he’s exploring and show us what he has done so far.

## Chris Trivino
### Candor Comments:
	- 1. Exceptional. Chris, once again you did a great job. I felt that your contributions really helped to lift the team and helped us to be able to understand what we were using and learning about.
	- 1. Chris, great job on figuring out how the model worked. If I could give you one piece of advice, it would be to help ensure we are all understanding how the model works. You seem to have a pretty great understanding of machine learning and the team could benefit greatly from you help. 
	- 1. I felt that I put in a lot of work this week. I completed additional regression models to compare against our XGBoostRegression Model and I researched and implemented random grid searching/ K fold validation. I also figured out how to graph my regression models to compare predictions to the true values. I felt I really did go above and beyond this week. Improvement: I sucked at communicating this week. I think right now my biggest improvement needs to be on communicating as a team member. I feel I know how to communicate well when I was the group leader, but I don’t want to overstep my boundaries as a team member and start following up with people and seeing where they are at. I think I may just email people one on one through slack to see what they are doing and what they have done.  Whoever is reading this (Noah or Bro. Falin I would appreciate any suggestions on how I can communicate correctly and efficiently as a team member without doing what the group leader is supposed to do, any feedback would be appreciated)

## David Yang
### Candor Comments:
	- 1- Exceptional. David, your contributions this week really helped the team. Your approach helped move the team in a good direction and overall made our models better.
	- 2. David, I was very impressed with your idea to take out the outliers in the data set. If I could give you one piece of advice, it would be spending some time to let us get to know you. We have loved having you in our group. We would love to get to know you better. 
	- 1. David had some really good insights and he really explored the data set. He actually was the only one to talk about potential ways to deal with outliers and he discovered how the outliers would affect our model later on. He had some really great insights and was very good at communicating new idea’s and what he was trying to learn. I like that he is vocal in sharing his ideas.Improvements: David did really good job this week, no further comments on improvement.

# **Group 4**
## Notes:
    - This group is the one that did not show up for the presentation despite being called.  I believe Stephen Harrison was the only one that showed up, but he was nonresponsive when he was asked if he was going to present or what was going on with his team.
    - Some of the scores for certain people are all over the place.  Gui Nascimento, Stephen Harrison, and Harrision Thorne all have weird scores.  It appears Domenick Casper and Leonardo Santos did most of the work.
    - We may want to split this team up, or figure out a solution for them.
## Domenick Casper
### Candor Comments:
	- 2. Requirements were met. You got us our model at the end, and spent a lot of time with data analysis. Spend more time with the team, sharing those insights, not working on it.
	- 2. You did a great job keeping everyone involved and gauging participation
	- I think you were a great PM. You helped us along the way and was very responsible with the project this week.
	- 1 He was the coding guy and he was actively working on trying to figure out the model. Without him, we would not have finished the assignment. Thank you for your hard work Domenick.
	- 2. I feel that you’re working well as a leader for our team! Thanks for taking the lead. Sometimes I feel that you delegate more than lead, but for the most part, I think you’re doing fine.

## Stephen Harrison
### Candor Comments:
	- 3. Slightly Deficient. You got some great insights for us dude, but we need you to spend some time with Python and play with the data in that way. Otherwise, the quality of our work will continue to go down! Great insights!
	- 2. Good job thinking of different ways to look at data to extract meaning.
	- I feel like you progressed a lot during the discussions. Keep being engaged and we can do a lot better next model.
	- 3 He participated in the meetings and actually tried to help whenever he got time to be with the team. Maybe participating more outside of class time would make sure we are on track and we are diving the work evenly.
	- 1. Honestly, no complaints. You’re a hard worker and it shows. Thanks for helping to carry our group forward.

## Gui Nascimento
### Candor Comments:
	- 5. Extremely Deficient. If I could give you some advice, spend more time attending class and take the data that we are provided and play with it. Spend some time learning how to use Python! It will greatly improve the team!
	- 2. Thank you for taking it upon yourself to research specific parts of the project in order to lessen the load on the team.
	- 4. Only showed up at the last minute to contribute to the summary. Besides that, you did not do anything at all. Maybe actually coming to class and participating in the model would be nice. 
	- 2. Although we’ve missed you here and there, I still think you’re a valuable member to the team. Keep up the good work!

> Grade: Median of [18, 23.25, 19.5, 23.25, (N/A)] = **~21.38** However I believe he should receive a 4.
## Leonardo Santos
### Candor Comments:
	- 3. Slightly Deficient. You helped a lot, and helped the group have understanding. Please spend some time with Python, and try to use it. Don’t rely on your teammates to get the assignment done. Help spread out the work!
	- 2. Thank you for taking it upon yourself to research specific parts of the project in order to lessen the load on the team.
	- You did great. You helped building the model in the word document and also gave your opinion during the discussions.
	- 2. I was able to actively participate throughout all phases of this week’s case study. It was only me and Domenick throughout most of the week after class trying to fix our model and we did basically 70% of the summary as well. 
	- 2. Thank you for participating! I think you’re making a great contribution to the team.
### Leonardo Santos Total:
> Score: [3, 2, (), 2, 2]  
> Grade: Median of [22, 23.25, (), 23.25, 23.25] = **23.25** Domenick rated him a 3, but the median is 2 so it work out to where I believe he should be.
## Harrison Thorne
### Candor Comments:
	- 6. No Attempt. You were active on Slack, but we need you to spend some time using Python and understanding the reading! It will help the team, and take a lot of pressure off of us.
	- 2. Thank you for being candid in your level of understanding of subject matters, we will do our best to help you.
	- Never heard your voice. I think you could help us during the discussions and if you know Python, help us finding the data for the case study.
	- 6 I still don’t know what your voice sounds like. Never heard it. He comes to class but does not say a word ever. Does not help with the model and did not touch the summary. I know you said you are busy, but we are all busy and still make time to work on this class. Maybe prioritizing your time better will help you later.
	- 4. With such a crammed semester, I understand that it’s hard to meet with so many groups. I’m working with the group right now to work out a predictable schedule, and hopefully that will help me attend more group meetings outside of class.
### Harrison Thorne Total:
> Score: [6, 2, (6), 6, 4]  
> Grade: Median of [25, 25, 25, 25, 25] = **0**  Of the scores that had a number associtated with him, he would have gotten a ~21.38.  However I believe that he did not do any work for this so I have extrapolated from Gui's score to assume that meant a six.  Which brings his median down to a 4.  Yet, I still do not think he did any work on this, and so I am giving him a zero.  We may want to look into giving him a different score for his executive summary.

### Candor Comments:
	- 3 – Slightly deficient. You were great to work with and seemed excited for whatever surprises or difficulties came our way. You also finished your work faster than the rest of us. If I had to give you one piece of advice, it would just be to share your ideas confidently and more often.
	- 2. I somehow think that the other three in this group including me did not give you too much of a chance to talk. I felt that when you tried to talk, somebody's talk overlapped your talk from talking at the same time. I feel sorry about that. I hope this event did not feel you excluded. And the other three include me worked earlier than the deadline, so we did not give you a chance to write your opinion on the summary paper. But I hope you can write your opinions even the other three kind of wrote your part up. When you read it, you may find many wrong ideas. So, don't be afraid to put your ideas. We need your brain.
	- 2 – Follows direction well, respectful, and willing to contribute. If I were to suggest an area in which to improve in it would be to be more engage further in conversation. I know the guys dominate the conversation a bit but do not be afraid butt in. Your input is valid and very insightful.

### Candor Comments:
	- 2 – All requirements were met. You were always at the cutting-edge for how we were looking at the data and what methods we used to analyze it. Your charts are very helpful and they got us off the ground fast. If I had to give you one piece of advice, it would be to give more insights from your economics classes, because I think those really helped for this project. 
	- 1. I tried to understand the background math. Spent lots of time to visualize data and try to find better model accuracy. One thing is that I hope I could understand how the model works quickly and search more about the model.
	- 2 – Jae is very dedicated, diligent and a self-starter. Gets work done on time. If I were to suggest an area in which to improve in it would be to ask more questions. I realized there were a few things you were uncertain about concerning the action plan. If I am being unclear, please ask questions so that we can all be on the same page.

	- 1. Good job leading the team this time. I liked all the ideas you suggested for this case study. The process to solve the problems were smooth. You did a lot of work too for the summary paper too.
	- 2 – Did as the best to my ability. I guided the meeting and made sure we had a plan of action by the end of each meeting. I think I could improve on having a more solid plan before the meeting. More than just brainstorming at least.

### Candor Comments:
	- 1 –Above and Beyond.If our personal success is to be measured by the amount that we learn and grow in a week, then I am comfortable that I rate a 1.  I learned SOmuchand spent a great deal of time exploring concepts related to our problem but outside the scopenecessary to satisfy therequirements (for the main thingsin this regard, I refer you to my response to question 1on this personal reflection).
	- 1. Excellent work early on the project, the work you did set a great foundation for the rest of the team. Even if all the work was not necessarily beneficial it still helped the team have insights of how to move forward. Continue to build upon the things we have learned so far, and you’ll keep being a strong foundation for the team.
	- 1 – Above and Beyond. Chris, if I could give you one piece of advice going forward, it would be to keep doing what you are doing. I think you are one of the top contributors to our team and I appreciate how much time you spend to understand the problem. Your insights have really been driving our team’s progress forward, so keep it up!
	- 1– It was clear you spent a lot of time on this project and I know there was a lot of time you spent reading, learning, and testing that cant be seen in a file. You helped us a lot this week, if you ever have any questions don’t delay in reaching out over slack and asking for suggestions to what your working on.

## Wyatt Ogden
### Candor Comments:
	- 1 –Above and Beyond. Wyatt, I am sovery grateful for yourdeeperunderstanding of the statistical and mathematical concepts related to our projects. Your insights add a lot. The only suggestion I have this week for you is that it might be helpful if you could find time toget further along on the project prior to our first team meeting on Monday. That's not really a criticism, because I don't know that it's fair to expect that from anyone (since I think the course requirements don't really specify that as an expectation ), merely an observation thatit would be beneficial if you were able to do so. 
	- 2 I was able to work on creating models and helped the team evaluate what the R^2 and RMSE scores signified. I have the most stats knowledge on my team so I tried to lean into my strengths for this project to have something unique I could contribute to the team. I was able to talk about how some features had overlapping information and so we only needed one or the other because having both could be detrimental to the model rather than helpful.
	- 1 – Above and Beyond. Wyatt, you did some awesome mathematical things this week that I didn’t understand. I think if we were given another day to integrate your findings, I think we could have really boosted our final model. If I could give you one piece of advice going forward, it would be to try to find patterns like that earlier in the week if you can, so we can implement it into our models. Either way, you are doing a great job, so keep it up!
	- 2–  I am so glad we have you to help us learn the statistical significance of our data. Your insights helped steer our group in a good direction in which we were able to learn and show a great deal more. Explore the assumptions of any statistical elements you use and help us understand even better. Avoid jargon and foreign terms to greater help us understand the same concepts you know.

### Candor Comments:
	- 1 –Above and Beyond. Breton, once again you were a solid anchor for our team.We rely heavily on your programming skills. I feel like you are able to synthesizethe ideas of everyone intoaprofessional-level implementation.For the second time, I don't really have any advice for you (and you are the only one I can say that of). I think you are going to do great in the professional world. Having been a corporate executive, and from what I have seen so far, I wouldn't hesitate to hire you. Keep up the good work!
	- 2 You did a great job taking the models other on the team made and incorporating what you had to move the team forward, you had a good balance of finding what was relevant to move forward and what was not needed that other produced. The formatting and notes in your notebook files make it easy to grasp what each code chunk is doing. Hopefully the career fair went well for you, I look forward working on the next module with you. 
	- 1 – Above and Beyond. Bretton, if I could give you one piece of advice going forward, it would be to keep doing what you are doing. You may not have had any special thing to bring to the executive summary this week, but you did do a lot of work on bringing in external data to try and get something. Keep it up! You’re doing great!
	- 2 – Your coding knowledge far surpasses my own and for all your insights and contributions I am grateful. As you take the reigns in leading us this next week, use things that you liked in our teamwork and address any faults we can work on.

## Jordan Watts
### Candor Comments:
	- 1 –Above and Beyond. Jordan, I thought you did an excellent job as team leader this week, and the work that you did with the geographical mapping was amazing! In retrospect --and this is no more on you than anyone else on the team --I think we need to make sure we are carefulto fully excel in the fundamental elements of the problem before we start exploring the exciting above-and-beyond elements, like geo-mapping.  That said, I was almost disappointed that we didn’tget to present this week because it meant we didn’t get to show off your map!
	- 1: excellent job with the geo-pandas and all the work you did to create those graphics. The visuals made it much easier to see how important location and waterfront truly were. All the members of the group were blown away with the graphics and I feel the TA was as well. Continue to find ways to express the data so that it is highly intuitive what is going on.
	- 1 – Above and Beyond. Jordan, if I could give you one piece of advice going forward, it would be to spend a little more time on the model. Your work with that geographical heatmap was amazing which is why I have given you this high score, but I think it may have taken a little too much of your time away from modeling. Keep up the great work!
	- 2– Keep working in reading the hints and asking good questions in group meetings I can tell your greatest weakness is in understanding how to code. While this isn’t the focus of the work we do it is still very important and will help you develop good models in the course and later on.

	- 3 – Slightly deficient. Make sure you are more involved during status meetings. 
	- 3 – Slightly Deficient. I think you should talk more, give more ideas and contribute more. Most of the time, you have the best results in the predictive models, it would be good for the team to know how you’re achieving what you are doing, I think that I’ve never seen until now a line of code written for you and I’d like to know how you’re achieving those results most of the time.
	- 2 You did a great job again this time around, able to contribute and come up with some really good data. One suggestion would be to maybe communicate with the team a bit more. 
	- 2 – Be sure to speak up when you make connections that are important so that we can use what you found.
	- 3 – Mars, your model was really good this week and the most accurate, good job! But it would be nice if you spoke up more in meetings and in slack, we would really like to hear your input.
	- 2 participated and was willing to help clarify questions for others. Helped others understand code and asked for help when he got stuck.

	- 2 – be sure to continue asking the TA questions when you do not understand something because we all learn when you ask questions.
	- 2 – Daniel you’re doing a good job at participating in the group and answering questions in chat, keep up the great work!
	- 2 Participated in meetings offered help with code and gave good coding examples. Always explained what his code did.

### Candor Comments:
	-  3 – Slightly deficient. Great job on providing helpful charts. I’d love it if you talk more during team meetings about how your model is doing and what obstacles you’re facing. 
	-  3 –  Slightly  Deficient.  If  I  can  give  you  an  advice  that  would  be  to  contribute  with  more ideas to the case study and talk more when we’re in the meetings, that would be very helpful for the team.
	- 2 you put a lot of work into this project, and you were able to communicate with your team a lot more this time around.  I would say that maybe you could pose more questions to the team, really get answers to things you don’t quite understand.
	- 3 – Jason, nice job on your model! Something you could work on this week is participating in slack a bit more.
	- 3 Was not very active in participation. Was willing to do what was asked of him. I think if he spoke up just a bit more and got more comfortable with the group it would help.

## Chance Lopata
### Candor Comments:
	- 3 – Slightly deficient. You do a great job in participating in the group meetings during class. One thing I would advise would be to make some time outside of class, so you are more prepared during the group meetings.
	- 2  –  All  requirements  were  met.  You  did  an  excellent  job,  and  you  were  always  to contribute with new ideas to the case study. I think you’re doing a good job and you just should keep doing that.
	- 2 Great job this last week, you asked a lot of really good questions to understand what you could do with your model better, that helped a lot of us with our models as well. One suggestion would be maybe to contribute more to the beginning stages on features we will want to have for the models.
	- 3 – I want ask more questions because I don’t feel like I really understand whats going on as much as I could.
	- 2 – Chance, you did a good job on your model this week, and you were actively participating in the class meetings, good job!
	- 2 came to classes and participated asking questions to help the conversations move forward.

## Keyanna Oliphant
### Candor Comments:
	- 3 – Slightly deficient. If I could give you one piece of advice going forward, it would be to make our status meetings a priority. You have amazing contributions when you’re present and engaged, so when you miss a meeting without letting us know ahead of time, it really hurts the team.
	- 2 – All requirements were met. I won’t give feedback about you this week because you were not part of the meeting because you had technical issues and that’s understandable, and after all, you were able to contribute to the group and give good ideas.
	- 4 – I think I’m obligated to give a low score because you missed 2 out of the 3 meetings, but since you had technology problems I am hoping that you’ll go talk to the professor and maybe get some points back. I don’t have a suggestion for improving since you missed the meetings and it wasn’t your fault.
	- 3 – For the part of the week I had a working computer, I did my best to actively participate in the group, however something I can do better before next module is having a back-up plan for what happens if I have technical difficulties so next time I don’t get locked out of participating. I also tried to work on some of the feedback I received last week by trying to more actively participate in slack when I was finally able to get back into slack.
	- 3 Had some computer difficulties that resulted in not coming to 2 meetings and being unable to really help out when she did come. She did still try and I don’t blame her for her computer giving out.

	- 1 – All requirements were met and beyond. You contributed with great ideas and help others in the group to achieve a good accuracy in their predictive model, also, you shared great data visualization which helped all the team to write a good executive summary and determine the best features for the model.
	- 3 – Try to make sure you can make it to all the meetings when you are the one in charge.
	- 2 – Great job with team lead this week, you did really well taking  initiative and the class meetings felt very organized this week. Great job!
	- 2. Really good work this time around, and especially with being the team lead. I would just say that maybe a little better communication to the group on expectations for each day and a heads up on when you won’t be able to make a meeting

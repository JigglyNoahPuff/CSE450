Trevor: 1 – I think that one thing that could be done is trying making more models and different types of models. Not just doing a one and done type of process. Andrew: 1 – Andrew, I thought that you did great and did everything that was asked by you. Jeremy: 3 – Jeremy, the main thing that I would suggest for you is to show up to the group meetings every class. With this first project we needed all the mind power that we could get. Adam: 1 – Adam, I think that you did great and added to the discussion and task that we had to complete. ILYA: 1 - ILYA, I think that you did great in contributing as much as you could to the model and discussion. I think that one suggestion that I have for you is to try and understand the model that we are studying better so that it will be easier to follow along.
